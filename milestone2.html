        World's Data Breaches and Hacks

        What is data breach?
    </h2>

    <div class="textTitle">
        <p class="textBox">
            A data breach is a security violation; whereby sensitive, protected and confidential information is
            exposed by intentional or unintentional means. This includes when the data is copied, transmitted,
            viewed, stolen or used by an individual unauthorized to do so. Incidents can range from concerted
            attacks by individuals who hack for personal gain such as black hats, organised crime, to hacking
            for the cause of political activists or national governments. Other causes include poorly configured
            system security or careless disposal of retired computer equipment or data storage media such as
            hard disks drive or solid state drives.
        </p>
        <p class="textBox">
            All in all, a data breach can occur accidentally or as the result of a deliberate attack. As the world
            becomes more digitized, data breaches are a major security concern because sensitive data is constantly
            being transmitted over the internet. Moreover, data is also stored in digital form by businesses all over
            the world, and the servers that store the data are often vulnerable to various forms of cyber-attack.

            organizations faced seven or more successful network attacks in the past 12 months, a 10% increase since the
            previous results.
            In addition, as data gets more and more digitized, there is also an increase in the amount of data loss
            during data breach

            Through different data breaches, companies are always losing confidential data. Among the different means
            that leads to data loss, hackers, followed by poor security system, contribute to the highest amount of
            data loss. One thing of important note is that, albeit interlinked, companies that lost confidential data
            due to hackers does not always imply that the companies do have poor security, for it could also mean a
            simple
            inside job, or loss of device that gave away access to confidential data outside of the company. <br />

            regards to catching up

        What is targeted in Data Breaches?
    </h2>
    <div class="textTitle">
        <p class="textBox">
            Although a data breach can be the result of an innocent mistake, there is still much damage to be caused if the 
            person with unauthorized access steals and disseminates personal information or corporate intellectual data for 
            financial gain or with the intention to cause harm. <br/><br/>

            Hackers learn a target's weak points, researching victims beforehand to learn about their vulnerabilities, such as 
            failed updates in a software to the company's employee susceptibility to phishing campaigns. They would then develop
            a campaign to get inside the company's network directly through hacking or indirectly by getting insiders to mistakenly
            download malware. <br/><br/>

            As an average breach takes more than five months to detect, each company can suffer from severe loss of data once a data 
            breach has occurred.<br/> <br/>

            Some common vulnerabilities:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Weak Credentials
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Majority of the data breaches are caused by stolen or weak credentials. This is due to the fact that most people
                            reuse passwords. This allows the cyber criminals to gain access to email, websites, bank accounts, and other sources of 
                            confidential information simply through brute force.                              
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stolen Credentials
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This vulnerability is mainly achieved through phishing. Cyber criminals will take advantage of the data loss through phishing
                            to access confidential information, leading to data breach.                                                                                                                                            
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Third-party access
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Cyber criminals can take advantage of third-party vendors access to the network to gain access to the company's system.                               
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                        <li>
                            Data breach can happen through personal devices belonging to the employees. This especially so if the employees' devices have outdated software,
                            or devices that allow download of malware-laden apps, this will lead to a data breach that give the hackers the data stored on the device.
                        </li>

            Based on the bar chart shows that the highest data type loss is personal details information and passwords
            followed closely by credit card and banking details.
            One possible reason for Personal Details information to be ranked first in type of data stolen was due to
            the possible usage of the information.

            According to <a

            , possible stolen data contain information such as home address, name, email address and credit card number.
            <br />

            This could lead to identity theft stated by <a
                href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/pl/security/news/online-privacy/identity-theft-and-the-value-of-your-personal-data">TrendMicro</a>

                        The steps are identification, assessment, mitigation and prevention. Those steps involve
                        identifying the technology and any possible risks. Follow by planning what kind of security risk
                        may happen and carrying out planning and implementation of the solutions.

                        href="https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/network-access-control.html">VMware</a>, network access control act as a gatekeeper in preventing any unauthorized device from entering the organization's network. 
                        This will help to prevent any bad actor from entering and affecting the networks. <br/>  <br/>

                         applying the zero trust security concept will allow the system to be more secure as the user will be required to request accessing certain location every single time even if it is from an authorized device.  </p>

                        recommends steps to mitigate cyber risks. These steps allow companies to reduce the
                        impact and remediate issues faced in data breaches. Common methods of remediation include
                        stopping breaches, fix vulnearabilties to prevent further attacks,
                        collect evidence for authorities and court, record methods of remediation, and inform affected
                        parties. </p>
