        World's Data Breaches and Hacks

        What is data breach?
    </h2>

    <div class="textTitle">
        <p class="textBox">
            A data breach is a security violation; whereby sensitive, protected and confidential information is 
            exposed by intentional or unintentional means. This includes when the data is copied, transmitted, 
            viewed, stolen or used by an individual unauthorized to do so. Incidents can range from concerted 
            attacks by individuals who hack for personal gain such as black hats, organised crime, to hacking 
            for the cause of political activists or national governments. Other causes include poorly configured 
            system security or careless disposal of retired computer equipment or data storage media such as 
            hard disks drive or solid state drives.
        </p>
        <p class="textBox">
            All in all, a data breach can occur accidentally or as the result of a deliberate attack. As the world 
            becomes more digitized, data breaches are a major security concern because sensitive data is constantly 
            being transmitted over the internet. Moreover, data is also stored in digital form by businesses all over 
            the world, and the servers that store the data are often vulnerable to various forms of cyber-attack.

            (CRI) for the second half of 2021, 76% of respondents expect a breach in the next 12 months. Over one-third of the 
            organizations faced seven or more successful network attacks in the past 12 months, a 10% increase since the previous results. 
            In addition, as data gets more and more digitized, there is also an increase in the amount of data loss during data breach
