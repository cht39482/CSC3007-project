        What is data breach?
    </h2>

    <div class="textTitle">
        <p class="textBox">
            A data breach is a security violation; whereby sensitive, protected and confidential information is
            exposed by intentional or unintentional means. This includes when the data is copied, transmitted,
            viewed, stolen or used by an individual unauthorized to do so. Incidents can range from concerted
            attacks by individuals who hack for personal gain such as black hats, organised crime, to hacking
            for the cause of political activists or national governments. Other causes include poorly configured
            system security or careless disposal of retired computer equipment or data storage media such as
            hard disks drive or solid state drives.
        </p>
        <p class="textBox">
            All in all, a data breach can occur accidentally or as the result of a deliberate attack. As the world
            becomes more digitized, data breaches are a major security concern because sensitive data is constantly
            being transmitted over the internet. Moreover, data is also stored in digital form by businesses all over
            the world, and the servers that store the data are often vulnerable to various forms of cyber-attack.
        </p>

        Data breaches are a concern for all organizations today

            A data breach can destroy a business.

            (CRI) for the second half of 2021, 76% of respondents expect a breach in the next 12 months. Over one-third
            of the
            organizations faced seven or more successful network attacks in the past 12 months, a 10% increase since the
            previous results.
            In addition, as data gets more and more digitized, there is also an increase in the amount of data loss
            during data breach

            Through different data breaches, companies are always losing confidential data. Among the different means
            that leads to data loss, hackers, followed by poor security system, contribute to the highest amount of
            data loss. One thing of important note is that, albeit interlinked, companies that lost confidential data
            due to hackers does not always imply that the companies do have poor security, for it could also mean a
            simple
            inside job, or loss of device that gave away access to confidential data outside of the company. <br />

        Types of data often targeted
    </h3>
    <div id="bar_chart_div"> </div>
    <div class="textTitle">
        <p class="textBox">
            Based on the bar chart shows that the highest data type loss is personal details information and passwords
            followed closely by credit card and banking details.
            One possible reason for Personal Details information to be ranked first in type of data stolen was due to
            the possible usage of the information.

            According to <a
                href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/articles/why-do-hackers-want-your-personal-information#:~:text=Stolen%20personal%20information%20is%20fuel%20for%20identity%20theft&text=Many%20online%20services%20require%20users,taking%20loans%20in%20their%20name.">F-secure</a>
            , possible stolen data contain information such as home address, name, email address and credit card number.
            <br />

            This could lead to identity theft stated by <a
                href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/pl/security/news/online-privacy/identity-theft-and-the-value-of-your-personal-data">TrendMicro</a>

            as the hacker could use those details to access their bank account for more money or even imposter someone
            by using their social media to further scam other people.

            A report done by

            in 2022 shows that between 2019 and 2021, there is at least 40% of data stolen are personal data while 50%
            are credentials and 10% are payments.
            Credential are targeted due to the possibility of using it to data breach against corporation organisations.
            An example by
            <a href="https://threatpost.com/data-theft-united-nations/169357/">Threatpost</a>
            shows, how Union Nation data breaches due to stolen credentials have been used to access third-party
